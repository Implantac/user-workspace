# User Workspace

## Project Overview
User Workspace is a Node.js application that facilitates interactions with a PostgreSQL database. It utilizes TypeScript, ensuring type safety and enhancing developer experience. The project showcases the capabilities of the `pg` library for database interactions and utilizes `tsx` for executing TypeScript files directly.

## Installation
To install the necessary dependencies, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/user-workspace.git
   cd user-workspace
   ```

2. Install the dependencies using npm:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Usage
To start using the application, you can run it with:

```bash
npx tsx path/to/your/script.ts
```

Replace `path/to/your/script.ts` with the path to the TypeScript file you wish to execute.

## Features
- **PostgreSQL Database Integration:** Direct connection and interaction with PostgreSQL using the `pg` module.
- **TypeScript Support:** Type safety and modern JavaScript features through TypeScript.
- **Easy Script Execution:** Direct execution of TypeScript files with `tsx`.
